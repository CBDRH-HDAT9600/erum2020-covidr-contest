<h1>Welcome to the CovidR Contest!</h1>


[**CovidR**](about.html) is an open-source contest launched by the 2020 European R users meeting ([**eRum2020**](https://2020.erum.io/)), featuring any work done with R around the topic of the [**COVID-19 pandemic**](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).

Contributions can be **[submitted](submit.html) until May 25th** and are made available in this website, where the wider community is invited to provide feedback. The winner will be announced on **June 15th**.

The current submissions feature the following contributions:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
meta <- rmdgallery::gallery_site_config()$gallery$meta

# create shields.yml with the dynamic label for the shields.io badges
shields_text <- lapply(meta, function(page_meta) {
  "Accepted"
})
yaml::write_yaml(shields_text, "shields.yml")

# create the list of contributions
htmltools::tags$ul(
  lapply(names(meta), function(name) {
    href <- sprintf("%s.html", name)
    one_meta <- meta[[name]]
    htmltools::tags$li(
      '"', htmltools::a(
        href = href, one_meta$title, .noWS = "outside"
      ), '"',
      "by", one_meta$author,
      "[", htmltools::a(
        "repository", href = one_meta$repository, target = "_blank", .noWS = "outside"
      ), "]"
    )
  })
)
```
